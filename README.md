📌 About Me

I am a **Computer Science Engineering student** at Vels University with a strong interest in **programming, web development, and tech exploration**.
Though I entered engineering without a computer science background in school, I am learning consistently and improving my problem-solving and coding skills every day.

I love building small projects, learning new technologies, and understanding how things work from the core — from programming logic to development and deployment. My goal is to create useful tools, websites, and apps that help learners like me grow in the tech field.
